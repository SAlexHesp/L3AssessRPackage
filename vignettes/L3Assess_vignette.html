<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div id="last-updated-november-2022-alex-hesp---dpird" class="section level4">
<h4>Last updated November 2022 (Alex Hesp - DPIRD)</h4>
<p>This package is intended as a toolbox of methods with analyses for conducting “level 3” assessments in Western Australia. These methods are typically “equilibrium” approaches, used when size and/or age data are available, together with information on various biological attributes of species, such as estimates of natural mortality, growth and maturity.</p>
<p>Typically, a level 3 assessment, as considered by DPIRD in Western Australia, involves producing a “catch curve” estimate of average ‘long term’ fishing mortality fitted to age or length composition data. The long-term ‘fishing mortality’ is either estimated directly, or indirectly from total mortality and natural mortality. Some catch curve methods also produce age or length-based estimates of selectivity.</p>
<p>The catch curve estimates of fishing mortality are often compared to estimates of natural mortality to inform about the (long-term average) level of fishing pressure the stock has experienced. Note that catch curve (equilibrium) estimates of fishing mortality typically pertain to the average value experience over the lifespans of all fish in the sample, and may not correspond to recent mortality (i.e. as the stock may not in equilibrium with respect to mortality and other factors, e.g. recruitment).</p>
<p>The estimates of ‘fishing mortality’ and selectivity may be used, in combination with other biological information (e.g. growth, maturity etc,) in per recruit analysis to calculate measures of population reproductive potential, such as spawning potential ratio (SPR). Per recruit analysis may be extended from the traditional form to include a stock-recruitment relationship, to account for potential impacts of fishing pressure on recruitment (i.e. through impacts on spawning stock levels). The estimates of spawning potential ratio (or relative female biomass, from extended per recruit analysis) are used as a proxy for female spawning biomass.</p>
<p>The estimates of ‘fishing mortality’, from catch curve analysis, female spawning potential ratio and relative female spawning biomass from per recruit analysis, may be compared against various standard points relating to fishing pressure (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(F_\mathrm{targ}=2/3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F_\mathrm{thresh}=M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F_\mathrm{lim}=3/2M\)</span>) and female spawning stock levels (<span class="math inline">\(B^\mathrm{rel}_\mathrm{targ}=0.4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B^\mathrm{rel}_\mathrm{thresh}=0.3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B^\mathrm{rel}_\mathrm{lim}=0.2\)</span>). The threshold levels are taken as proxies for long-term levels of fishing and biomass expected to yield maximum sustainable yield. Note, however, that if (in particular) the ‘steepness’ of the stock recruitment relationship is lower than typical for marine broadcast spawning fishes (~0.75), which would be indicative of lower stock productivity (e.g. some shark species), then the values of the reference points would need to be more conservative.</p>
<p>The package contains several age- and length-based routines for catch curve analysis, per recruit analysis, and an “extended” form of per recruit analysis with a stock-recruitment relationship. It also contains an analysis for calculating length-based selectivity given estimates of selectivity parameters for fish caught by gillnet fishing. The various R functions output a range of statistics and diagnostic plots.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a ‘trial version’ with testing of the various routines continuing. Please report any identified issues to Alex Hesp (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Alex.Hesp@dpird.wa.gov.au}\)</span>).</p>

<h3>Chapman and Robson (1960) mortality estimator</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{Z} = \ln\bigg[1+\overline{X}-\frac{1}{n}\bigg]^{-1}-\ln\overline{X}-\bigg[\frac{{(n-1)(n-2)}}{n(t+1)(n+t-1)}\bigg]
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is the mean age above the age at full recruitment into the fishery, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size and <span class="math inline">\(t=n\overline{X}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An approximate estimate of the variance of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> (for large sample sizes) may be determined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{\sigma}^2 = \bigg[\frac{(1-\exp(\hat{Z}))^2}{n\exp(\hat{Z}))}\bigg]
\]</span> see Smith et al. (2012). Thus, an approximate 95% confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> may be calculated as <span class="math inline">\(1.96\sigma\)</span>. Alternatively, 95% confidence intervals for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are calculated using resampling with replacement (bootstrapping). The resampling procedure involves producing a specified number (500) random age frequency data sets, and applying the calculating Chapman and Robson (1960) mortality formula to each of these to produce 500 estimates for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. The point estimate for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, from resamping, is taken as the median of the 500 calculated values for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, and the lower and upper 95 confidence limits as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles, respectively. For visualisation, the resampling procedure is also used to produce estimated frequencies of fish at age (above the age at full selection) with associated 95% confidence limits, based on the survival function, i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{N_t} = N_0\exp(-Zt)
\]</span> where, for a given random data set, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{N_t}\)</span> is the estimated number at relative age <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span> is the observed number of fish at the calculated recruitment age (determined from the original data set), at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is relative age. The observed and estimated frequencies at age can be visualised in normal or log space (for comparison with other age-based catch curve methods).</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[

    \log_e(N_t) = \log_e(N_0)-Z_t\\

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> represents the numbers of fish in the population at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span> is the initial recruitment (e.g. Haddon, 2011). The value for total mortality, <span class="math inline">\(Z_t\)</span>, is taken as the negative of the slope of the line. It is assumed that the catch of fish at age <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is proportional to the number of fish in the population at that age, and that the population is at equilibrium with respect to mortality and recruitment. The model is fitted using the lm function in R, applying the predict function to estimate 95% confidence limits for the fitted line. Approximate 95% confidence intervals for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are be calculated as <span class="math inline">\(1.96\sigma\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the estimate of the standard error for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> produced by the lm function.

Z_a = F_a+M
\]</span> The instantaneous rate of natural mortality, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, may be calculated from an empirical equation such as that of Hoenig’s (1983) equation for fish, i.e. <span class="math display">\[

For visualisation, model estimates of the frequency of fish at each age, with associated 95% confidence intervals, are calculated using a parametric resampling approach, assuming the estimated model parameters conform to a multivariate normal distribution. The mvrnorm function within the MASS package is used together with the values of the estimated model parameters and associated variance-covariance matrix to generate 500 random values of each of the model parameters.

<h2>Length-based catch curve methods</h2>
<div id="length-based-catch-curve" class="section level3">
<h3>Length-based catch curve</h3>
<p>This sex-structured length-based catch curve approach allows for common or divergent growth between the two sexes, growth variation (by applying sex-specifid length-transition matrices), and assumes common selectivity and fully-selected fishing mortality (and natural mortality) for the two sexes. Growth can be based on either a von Bertalanffy growth curve or Schnute growth curve. The approach involves calculating expected survival and catches for each sex, per recruit, given specified values for natural mortality, growth parameters (and associated variation), weight-at-length parameters, and model parameters for selectivity and fishing mortality.</p>
<p>As a word of caution method, in its current version, this method (and age and length based method described below) is likely best suited for medium to longer-lived (&gt; 10 y) species (as the model employs an annual timestep; in short-lived species this may not be sufficient to capture growth/selectivity changes well). Although the model is sex-structured, allowing for potential differences in growth, the model can be separately fitted to sex-specific data, by inputting a single set of growth parameters for that sex.</p>

<h3>Estimating uncertainty for model outputs</h3>
<p>For visualisation, model estimates of the proportion of fish in each length class, with associated 95% confidence intervals, are also calculated using a parametric resampling approach, assuming the estimated model parameters conform to a multivariate normal distribution. The mvrnorm function within the MASS package is used together with the values of the estimated model parameters and associated variance-covariance matrix to generate 200 random values of each of the model parameters. These, in turn, are used to produce 200 sets of model estimates for the expected proportion of fish in each length class.

<p>Note that this catch curve routine was recently updated to allow use of alternative model time step values (e.g. 1/12 of a year vs 1 year). The updated routine updates the survival and growth of the modelled population cohort according to the specified modelled time step (the mathematics outline above, which has not yet been updated, is correct for an annual timestep). For shorter-lived species (e.g. &lt; 10 y), it is likely more appropriate to use a shorter model timestep (if samples are collected at intervals throughout the year), such that the modelled length compositions more closely match observed data, by allowing fish to grow throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Length and age-based catch curve</h3>
<p>This model applies the same set of equations as described above for the length-based catch curve, but is fitted using a modified objective function with two components, the first associated with the marginal length composition (as described above), and the second, with conditional ages-at-length. The approach estimates logistic selectivity parameters (<span class="math inline">\(L_{50}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_{95}\)</span>), von Bertalanffy growth parameters (<span class="math inline">\(L_{\infty,s}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k,s\)</span>) and fully-selected fishing mortality (<span class="math inline">\(F^*\)</span>). As with the above length-based model, this model is also sex-structured, allowing growth to be estimated simultaneously for both sexes, whilst assuming common length-based selectivity and fully-selected fishing mortality. Single sex data can also be inputted, allowing for growth, selectivity and fishing mortality to be estimated separately for each sex.</p>
<p>Following Piner et al. (2016), the distribution of ages for a given length class is assumed to follow a multinomial distribution. The log-likelihood for <span class="math inline">\({C}_{l,a}\)</span>, the number of fish in the catch in length class <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> at age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, is calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\lambda_2=\sum_{s}\sum_{l}\sum_{a}{C}_{s,l,a}\log_e(\hat{P_s}{(a|l)})
\]</span></p>
<p>In the above equation, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P_s}(a|l)\)</span> is the expected conditional proportion of fish, of sex <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, in the catch at age <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> given length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, which calculated as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{P_s}{(a|l)}=\frac{\hat{P_s}(l|a)\hat{P_s}(a)}{\sum_{a}\hat{P_s}(l|a)\hat{P_s}(a)}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\hat{P_s}(a) = \frac{\hat{C}_{s,a}}{\sum_{s,a}\hat{C}_{s,a}}
\]</span> and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{P_s}(l|a) = \frac{\hat{C}_{s,l,a}}{\sum_{l}\hat{C}_{s,l,a}}
\]</span> The overall log-likelihood is calculated as the sum of the log-likelihoods associated with the marginal length composition, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span> (as described above for the length-based catch curve method) and the conditional age at length log-likelihood, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that this catch curve routine was recently updated (Jan, 2023) to allow use of alternative model time step values (e.g. 1/12 of a year vs 1 year). The updated routine updates the survival and growth of the modelled population cohort according to the specified modelled time step (the mathematics outline above, which has not yet been updated, is correct for an annual timestep). For shorter-lived species (e.g. &lt; 10 y), it is likely more appropriate to use a shorter model timestep (if samples are collected at intervals throughout the year), such that the modelled length compositions more closely match observed data, by allowing fish to grow throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Length-converted catch curve (regression approach)</h3>
<p>A length-converted catch curve (e.g. see Pauly 1990, 1995), is typically a linear regression, and may be described as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
    \log_e[N/{\Delta}_t] = a+bt&#39;_{m}
\end{align}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the observed number of fish in a given length class, <span class="math inline">\({\Delta}_t\)</span> is the time taken for fish to grow through that length class, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the y intercept, <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;_m\)</span> is the mean (relative) age of fish at the mid-point of that length class. The negative of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> equates to total mortality, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. If the growth of the species is described by a von Bertalanffy growth curve, the relative age of fish at the lower bound (<span class="math inline">\(t_{lw}\)</span>), upper bound (<span class="math inline">\(t_{up}\)</span>) and mid-point of length class <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;_l\)</span>, may each be calculated from the inverse von Bertalanffy growth equation, i.e. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
    t&#39;=-(1/k)(\log_e(1-(L_{t&#39;}-L_\infty))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> is the relative age, <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are the asymptotic length and growth coefficient parameters of the growth curve, and <span class="math inline">\(L_t&#39;\)</span> is the length, at <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span>. In this package, length-converted catch curves may also be calculated for fish with growth described by a Schnute growth curve, for cases where the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are not equal to zero. That is, where growth is described as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L_t=\bigg((y_1^b+(y_2^b-y_1^b))\frac{1-\exp(-a(t-t_1))}{1-\exp(-a(t_2-t_1))}\bigg)^{1/b}
\]</span> In this case, relative ages may be calculated from the inverse Schnute growth equation as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
t&#39;=\frac{\log_e(1-(L_{t&#39;}^b-y_1^b)/(y_2^b-y_1^b)(1-\exp(-a(t_2-t_1))))}{-a+t_1}
\]</span> In this implementation, using either growth curve model, the values of <span class="math inline">\({\Delta}_t\)</span> are calculated as <span class="math display">\[
{\Delta}_t=t_{up}-t_{lw}
\]</span> The length-converted catch curve model is using the lm() function in R, which outputs estimates of the linear model parameters, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and associated standard errors. Approximate 95% confidence limits for the parameters are calculated as <span class="math inline">\(1.96SE\)</span>. Approximate 95% confidence limits for the fitted line, estimated at the midpoint of each length class, are calculated from the outputs of the linear model, using the predict() function.</p>

<h2>Extended per recruit analysis (allowing for stock-recruitment dynamics in age and length-based per recruit models)</h2>

<h3>Allowing for error in per recruit calculations</h3>
<p>This implementation of per recruit analysis allows for incorporation uncertainty in estimates of fishing mortality, natural mortality and steepness, assuming independent normal distributions for each of these parameters. Estimates of key outputs from per recruit analysis, with uncertainty, are produced using parametric sampling to produce a specified number (e.g. 500) of F, M and h values, which are inputted into the deterministic per recruit equations (i.e. within the CalcYPRAndSPRForFMort() function), to produce 500 sets of estimated results of key parameters of interest. Lower and Upper 95% confidence limits are taken as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the 500 estimates.</p>
<p>Note, it is also possible to incorporate other sources of uncertainty, such as for growth and maturity ogives, if estimates are available for the both parameters of each ogive and associated variance-covariance matrix (such as are outputted by the WAFishBiolgy R package. ‘Wrapper’ code has been developed but not yet been built into the package. The process involves use of the CalcYPRAndSPRForFMort() function for each set of input parameters, and storing and analysing the outputs to produce confidence limits.</p>
